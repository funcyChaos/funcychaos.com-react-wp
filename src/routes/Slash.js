			<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
			<p>I started programming in junior high, using the language B.A.S.I.C. and soon wanted to program video games. When I turned 18 I started working in a machine shop and I didn't stop for 10 years. Then I got bored with machining and decided to pick up where I left off with programming. I learned Assembly and C++ to work towards a foundation for video game development. And soon after started an apprenticeship with Bitwise studying WordPress development as well as developing themes with a team for multiple clients.

			I really feel at home with lower level languages, and I have come to really enjoy embedded C for personal projects. And when I'm not focused on hardware projects in my free time, I love working on my drift car (although sometimes those are the same thing )</p>
